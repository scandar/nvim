# My NeoVim configuration
This is my personal NeoVim config, it's a minimal config made to optimize my workflow. It mainly focuses on tooling related to TypeScript/JavaScript, Vue, and web development in general.

Plugins live under `lua/plugins`
General configuration lives under `lua/config.lua`

Feel free to fork and use for your own.
